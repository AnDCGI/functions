Maya One Click Scene Change
this Script Is Designed To Change Scene Scale Like For FX, Lighting Etc.
Designed To Work As A Shelf Button Inside Maya And Especially Made To Work
With Alembic Files.
By Default It Will Scale Everything Down To 0.1 In All Axis, User Can Later
Change The Scale At Any Point.

This Is A Headless Script So Doesn't Prints Anything To Maya Command Line As
Of Now
